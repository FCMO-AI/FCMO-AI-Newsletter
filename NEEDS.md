# Integration requests from WP-B

## WP-B2 slot contract (deferred)

WP-B2 may add community integration only through the slots owned by the paper
template lane. It must not edit `community/ghost-theme/` or invent a second
Ghost client.

- `slot:subscribe`: a no-JavaScript-safe link to the Ghost portal signup. The
  link must remain useful when JavaScript is disabled and must not expose an
  email address or token in the static paper.
- `slot:cartas`: a best-effort rail of up to three published Ghost posts tagged
  `cartas`, ordered newest first. A timeout, 4xx/5xx, malformed payload or
  missing API key is a normal empty-rail result; the paper build remains
  successful and must not cache private/member data.
- `slot:banner`: reserved for the reader-facing edition/freshness banner. B2
  must not change its state or copy; it only places the already-localized
  banner emitted by A3b.

The paper-side adapter should receive `GHOST_CONTENT_URL` and
`GHOST_CONTENT_API_KEY` from its caller, use a bounded timeout (5 seconds),
and expose only `title`, `url`, `custom_excerpt`, `published_at` and an
allowlisted feature image URL. It must never call the Admin API.

## A3a/A3b integration points

- A3a owns `design/tokens.json`. `community/ghost-theme/build.sh` reads it
  when present and never writes it; the checked-in theme has a safe local
  fallback so the B1 lane remains independently buildable.
- A3b should call `tools/paper/pwa.py build --source <candidate> --out
  <candidate>` after static routes are generated, or perform the equivalent
  copy. The PWA manifest, service worker, icons and registration marker are
  expected at the candidate root, including `/favicon.ico`.
- The PWA service worker deliberately does not cache `data/newsroom-status`
  or any freshness/health document. A3b must not add a broad `cache.addAll`
  over the generated data tree.

## Operator boundaries

Ghost(Pro), real email delivery, domain/DNS, postal address and production
credentials remain blocked by the operator decisions in `OPERADOR.md`. The
implementation and tests in this lane use only the local `MockGhost`; no real
mail or external account is contacted.

# Integration requests from WP-A3

These changes are outside WP-A3 ownership and were not made here.

1. **WP-A4 / `pages.yml`: wire the OG stage into the publication build.** Run
   `tools/paper/og_image.py` into a temporary directory, then pass that directory
   to `tools/paper/build.py --og-source <dir>`. The SSG copies the validated cards
   to `publish/og/` and emits their PNG URLs in OG and JSON-LD metadata. Without
   this flag it deliberately keeps the existing local explainer as a valid
   fallback image.
2. **WP-C1 / approved legal copy:** provide the finalized locale content owned by
   `site-src/content/legal/**` and align its file interface with the SSG during
   integration. Until then, the generated privacy, license, and disclaimer routes
   state that approved legal copy is pending, and subscription remains inactive.
3. **Integration runner with browser/socket permission:** run the A3c PNG command,
   the browser harness, and the required `shot.mjs` matrix. This sandbox refuses
   both loopback sockets and Chromium startup, so no defensible screenshot sheet
   can be produced here. The operator visual decision O-14 therefore remains open.
